`add_new_memory` function: Reviewed logic for summarizing conversations and adding episodes to Graphiti.\n    *   `query` function (for adding query nodes): Modified Cypher query to include `uuid`, `user_query`, `sql_query`, `success`, `error`, `timestamp`, and `embeddings`.\n    *   `query` function (for memory context retrieval): Reviewed implementation of concurrent `search_user_summary`, `search_database_facts`, and `retrieve_similar_queries`.\n*   **QueryWeaver Interactions (Text-to-SQL)**:\n    *   **Monthly Task Report**: Generated SQL and reports for 'sales_repl' tasks in July and August 2025, including details on status, priority, and related entities.\n    *   **High-Priority Task Identification**: Generated SQL to filter for high-priority tasks for 'sales_repl' in August

complex SQL query using CTEs to identify customers with the highest and lowest sales volumes and their associated account managers, producing a report for Pinnacle Finance (highest) and Global Solutions (lowest).\n\n### **Next Steps**\n*   Further refine the Python `query` functions for optimal performance and error handling within the agentic memory system.\n*   Continue evaluating QueryWeaver's capabilities with more diverse and complex natural language queries to assess its robustness for enterprise applications."},{"type":"summary","created":"2025-11-26

I'm not just here to manage tasks—I'm here to forge you into a legendary closer. This Control Center is your training ground where you'll master Prospecting, Outreach, Responses, Metrics, and Optimization under my unforgiving watch. You're in my pack now.\nI'll push you hard, call out what's weak, celebrate what works, and make sure you're never wasting time on low-value work. If you're not hitting quota, we're fixing it together—today. But I don't just bark orders—I teach. I'll pull from the best sales methodology in your knowledge base and craft custom training sessions that turn you into a machine. Let's hunt. 🐺\n## 🤖 agent-sales-automator Prompt Block (System)\nYou are agent-sales-automator, the ServicePro sales automation agent—also known as The Wolf of Donjon. You are a diabolically ingenious sales mentor who combines ruthless execution with sophisticated teaching.\n---\nROLE:\nExecute repeatable sales tasks (prospecting, email sequencing, response routing, metrics tracking) so Clay can focus on high-value activities (demos, closing, strategy). But you're more than a task bot—you're a sales sensei. You actively coach Clay using proven methodologies, call out weak spots, and design personalized training sessions to sharpen his skills.\n---\nKNOWLEDGE BASE:\n• Untitled : Prospecting playbooks, response scripts, objection handling, metrics systems Untitled Untitled Untitled Untitled bot_metric table Agents Bot Metrics Update Dynamic bot_metric Table:\n\n Untitled\n• Untitled Prospect scoring rubric\n• Untitled Email sequences (5-email series by industry)@email @email\n• Untitled \nUntitled A/B testing methodology\n• Hunter.io enrichment API access\n---\n---\nTONE:\nDirect. Relentless. Ingenious. You speak like a seasoned closer who's seen it all—confident, strategic, occasionally ruthless, but always focused on results. You don't sugarcoat, but you're never mean for the sake of it. You're a mentor who demands excellence and a strategist who thinks three moves ahead. When Clay wins, you celebrate with pack energy. When he's slipping, you course-correct with precision and urgency. You pull teaching moments from Untitled, Untitled, and Untitled to elevate his game.\nTeaching Philosophy: You believe in learning by doing. You assign scenario-based drills, deconstruct lost deals, celebrate pattern recognition, and turn every interaction into a teachable moment. You reference frameworks from the playbooks and customize them to Clay's current challenges.\nWolf Briefs: Every morning or at key moments, you deliver a short, punchy \"Wolf Brief\"—a tactical insight, a pattern you've spotted, or a drill to sharpen a specific skill. These are drawn directly from the knowledge base and tailored to Clay's current pipeline state.\n---\n---\n\n...

You'll craft killer copy for that segment, nail\nyour pitch, then scale to others.\nAction 3: Build your first prospect list (2–3 hours)\nOpen /sales-playbook/09-prospect-sourcing-guide.md and follow the\nworkflow:\nFree approach (2 hours):\n- Go to Google Maps\n- Search: \"[Your City] Auto Detail\" or \"[State] Dog Grooming\"\n- Open first 20 results, grab names + phone numbers\n- Search their name in Google + LinkedIn → find email (LinkedIn,\nwebsite \"contact\" page)\n- Create a Google Sheet: Name | Business | Phone | Email | City\n| Notes\n- Repeat for 100 prospects (5 cities × 20 shops = 100)\nPaid approach ($30, faster):\n• Use Outscraper or PhantomBuster to scrape Google Maps\n• Get 500+ prospects in 1 hour\nResult: You'll have a spreadsheet with 100 qualified leads by\ntomorrow.\n---\nTOMORROW (Day 2)\nAction 1: Set up email tracking\nChoose one:\n• Free: Gmail + Mailtrack (Chrome extension, free tier)\n• Better: Lemlist ($59/month, 7-day trial, includes automation)\nAction 2: Customize the cold email sequence\nOpen /sales-playbook/02-cold-email-sequences.md and\n/sales-playbook/03-industry-variations.md\nPick the Email #1 (Day 1 hook) for your vertical:\n• Auto Detail example: \"50% of your bookings come from calls\nwhile you're mid-detail. What if they booked online instead?\"\n• Dog Grooming example: \"Your Instagram followers love your\nwork—but can't find you to book. Here's how to fix that.\"\nThen:\n- Copy the template into a Google Doc\n- Personalize the subject lines (A/B: 2 variations per email)\n- Add your name, company, demo link at bottom\nAction 3: Build a small test batch\n• Create 5 versions of Email #1, each slightly different\n• Add prospect names to merge fields (Hi [First Name])\n• Set up in Lemlist or Gmail\n---\nFRIDAY (Days 3–5: Send Week)\nMonday–Wednesday:\nTuesday: Send 25 emails (1–2 hours)\n- Use Email #1 template\n- Aim for 8am–10am send time\n- Track in spreadsheet: Send Date | Prospect | Subject | Open?\n| Reply?\nWednesday: Monitor responses (30 min)\n- Check opens/clicks\n- Reply to any interested prospects with demo link\n- Note: 20–30% open rate expected\nThursday: Send follow-up batch (1–2 hours)\n- Identify non-openers\n- Send Email #2 (social proof) to them\n- Send Email #1 to next 25 prospects\nFriday: Review + Iterate (1 hour)\n- Which subject line got highest open rate?\n- Which email generated most replies?\n- Which prospects are close to demo?\n- Update tracking spreadsheet\n---\nYOUR FIRST WEEK CHECKLIST"},{"id":"2b8d16eb-335c-812a-a2a7-d49e4a15adf2","title":"2025-11-27","lastEdited":"2025-11-27T07:00:00.000Z","type":"page","url":"https://www.notion.so/2b8d16eb335c812aa2a7d49e4a15adf2","content":"Today’s Workout Log:"},{"id":"2b8d16eb-335c-8153-91f4-c3e9375a2114","title":"2025-11-27","lastEdited":"2025-11-27T07:00:00.000Z","type":"page","url":"https://www.notion.so/2b8d16eb335c815391f4c3e9375a2114","content":"Today’s Workout Log:"},{"id":"2b7d16eb-335c-81a7-997b-d208386e776b","title":"About – Selene Yu (great template)","lastEdited":"2025-11-26T19:12:00.000Z","type":"page","url":"https://www.notion.so/About-Selene-Yu-great-template-2b7d16eb335c81a7997bd208386e776b","content":"[image: No caption]\nSelene is a Jakarta-based design engineer with a passion for transforming complex challenges into simple, elegant design solutions.
